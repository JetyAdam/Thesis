# Application for Managing SSL Certificates

This bachelorâ€™s thesis aims to develop a new application for managing SSL certificates
within the organization of Red Hat. The primary goal of this development is to enhance
the efficiency of SSL certificate management for Red Hat employees. The application en-
ables centralized storage and processing of certificates, providing timely notifications for
impending expirations. Additionally, it facilitates the creation of Jira tickets for neces-
sary certificate renewals. Consequently, this initiative aims to mitigate application outages
caused by expired certificates, providing employees with more effective solutions.
